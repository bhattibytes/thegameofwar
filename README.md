# The Game of War
### Mintbean Hackathon - Requirements
May the odds be in your favour. Build me a card game.

Playing cards are at least ten centuries old. There are many decks, many games for each deck, and many variants of each game, and all that complexity makes the world of playing cards a fascinating subject of conversation, study, and of course, play.

- You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's poker, blackjack, or just high-card wins, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:
- Your game must be played with cards from the standard 52-card deck.
- Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, getting rid of all your cards.
- Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, scoring the lowest number of points.
- Accidental duplications of a card will be considered a bug, for which you will lose points. (See the scoring rubric for more details on how bugs affect your score)
- No collectible card games or non-standard decks allowed (so for example, no Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon. And no Tarot cards either.)
